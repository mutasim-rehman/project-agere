# 8 GB tier study decisions

**Study:** `tier8-8gb-v1`  
**SSD:** `H:\AGERE` (`AGERE_SSD_ROOT`)  
**Repo:** `D:\project-agere`  
**Date:** 18 October 2026

This file records choices and blockers for the overnight 8 GB run. It does not replace `DEVELOPMENT_START.md`. Where this file narrows the study, the narrowing is the 8 GB-only scope the user requested.

## Scope

- Only the 8 GB tier.
- SAS: `Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct` GGUF `Q4_K_M`.
- MAS: 1.5B F16 orchestrator/drafter, 0.5B F16 extractor, 0.5B F16 verifier.
- Resident loading is attempted first. If the combined weights do not fit the cap, the team is sequential load/unload and is labeled as such.
- Inference is CPU (`n_gpu_layers=0`). The GPU is only for QLoRA.
- Dev is 150 cases (100 KYC + 50 credit). The frozen test split is KYC 100 + credit 75 and is not opened until `frozen_systems.json` exists.
- Seed 42, temperature 0, one greedy run. Extra seeds would repeat the same outputs.
- FRAMES is a control after the headline, if time remains. MortarBench is not the headline.
- Headline metrics: invention rate (lower is better) and mismatch recall (higher is better), plus grounding and refusal. Scoring is `scripts/phase3.py` through `scripts/tier8_study.py`.
- A hardened change is kept only if dev invention falls or mismatch recall rises and the other does not collapse (`better()` in `scripts/tier8_study.py`).

## RAM cap

The cap is `min(6.4 GB, available RAM minus 1 GB safety)`. It is not raised to force a model to fit.

On 18 October 2026 the host had 16.39 GB total and about 6.7 GB available. The effective cap was about 5.68 GB. Loading `qwen2.5-7b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf` crossed that cap in about 20 seconds. The runner stopped the process. No dev case was scored. ChatGPT, Spotify, and Cursor were left running.

A later measurement the same night showed 6.8 GB available, so the cap was 5.8 GB. One retry was run. At 6.85 GB available the cap was 5.85 GB. The 7B Q4 load reached 6.40 GB RSS and the runner stopped it. No dev case was scored. Inference attempts stop here. They resume only when available memory is high enough for a 6.40 GB load to sit inside the cap, which means the cap must be at least 6.40 GB. The nominal ceiling is 6.40 GB, so that requires available memory of at least 7.40 GB before the process starts. ChatGPT, Spotify, and Cursor were not closed.

## Packages

Installed into `D:\project-agere\.venv` on 18 October 2026:

- `torch==2.6.0+cu124` from `H:\AGERE\tmp\torch-2.6.0+cu124-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl`. CUDA is available on the RTX 4050.
- `transformers==5.20.1`, `peft==0.21.2`, `accelerate==1.15.0`, `bitsandbytes==0.50.2`.

QLoRA was not started. The order runs training only after the naive dev floor exists, and that floor does not exist.

## Result

There is no invention rate and no mismatch recall. The untouched comparison, the fine-tune, the hardened team, and the held-out test did not run.

## Policy corpus

Both hardened arms share the synthetic SOP at `H:\AGERE\datasets\policy\agere-policy-v1\sop.jsonl`. It is original project text. Official SBP wording is not invented. Naive runs still see policy retrieval as unavailable, matching the Phase 3 floor.

## QLoRA

The RTX 4050 has 6 GB of VRAM. The locked sequence length is 2048. If that step does not fit, training uses 512 tokens and the deviation is labeled. The SFT rows are short JSON tasks and are not truncated by 512 in any material way. Training reads only the finetune train and finetune-dev files. The test split is not used.

The scored SAS remains the Q4 GGUF under the RAM cap. A GGUF LoRA is applied only if conversion succeeds. Otherwise the frozen SAS is the base Q4 with the staged prompt, and the adapter status is written as such.

The torch wheel is `H:\AGERE\tmp\torch-2.6.0+cu124-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl` (download completed). If `bitsandbytes` fails on Windows, QLoRA is skipped and the comparison continues with the base Q4 file.

## Sequential team

If resident MAS weights do not fit under 90% of the cap, the reported 8 GB team is sequential. That result is not described as resident.

## Runs that break the cap

A run whose peak RSS exceeds the cap is invalid. It is not averaged into the result.
